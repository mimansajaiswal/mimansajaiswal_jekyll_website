title: Lessons from the Quill
---

After I shared the [news](learning-opencv3-book) regarding my book going live for pre-order, a few people were curious to know about the details of how the entire publishing process operates. In this post, I talk about the “behind the scenes” of publishing and the lessons that I picked up along the way. I have chronicled my journey by dividing it into VI Acts, each describing a significant milestone in the process.

The last time I wrote something technical, it was less than a quarter of the length of "Learning OpenCV 3 Application Development" and 24 credits along with a Masters degree were at stake. The 6 months, 9 chapters and 300+ pages have taught me more than I could ever have bargained for - about the subject, about writing and myself. Before the post starts, a few disclaimers are in order. This article is not representative of how the publishing industry operates in general. In fact, my experiences constitute a rather miniscule data point in the gigantic space of the publishing market. I have come to know that the variations, even within the sub-space of academic publishing, are reasonably high.


### Act I - Beginnings

From the point of view of a prospective author, the publishing process usually starts with finding the right publisher to collaborate with. Let’s say that you have an idea for your next book, and maybe you’ve even got a few sample chapters penned down. The first (and possibly the hardest) step is to approach publishers and convince them to publish your work. Fortunately, in my case, things started off on a slightly different route. The folks at Packt Publishers reached out to me.

One fine morning, as I was pacing along the platform, waiting for my train to Andheri, I unlocked my phone to an email from an Acquisition Editor at Packt. She expressed her interest in discussing the possibility of a collaboration for a book on OpenCV/C++. I was pretty excited with the scope and prospects of the project as it gave me a chance to work at the intersection of two of my long-term passions — Vision and writing. Plus, the timing couldn’t have been better. I was on the verge of migrating from the industry to academics and therefore I wasn’t under too much work pressure at my then current job. Also, since I was to be the sole author of the book, it would provide me with a sense of total and complete ownership and simultaneously avoid potential creative clashes with co-authors. Not that I am opposed to collaborations, but I wanted to explore the entire spectrum of the publishing experience by myself through my first writing project. The conditions were opportune and I reverted with an enthusiastic yes.

### Act II - Battle Plan

Over the course of the next few email exchanges, the Publishers shared very specific ideas about their goals, how the book should be structured (at a very abstract level), the target audience, technology stack etc. Since this was my first rendezvous with “commercial” academic publishing, I had a lot of queries that they were more than willing to address.

The next big step was sharing a detailed “Book Outline”. The prospective authors are expected to share their vision and plan for the book with the Board of Editors via the “Book Outline” — a document that lays down the blue-prints for the book (a comprehensive battle plan). The outline that I shared took me an entire weekend to write and was around 8 pages long. As you delineate your target audience, objectives, mission, detailed chapter-wise outline and author-bio, this is a chance for you to be at your persuasive best. The final outline should resonate with the goal that the Publishers discussed earlier.

At this point, the Publishers will also share a target for the total number of pages that the book should span. I started out with a goal of ~250 pages and by the time the book reached a stage where it was ready to be published, it turned out to be 310 pages long!. It is the prospective author’s prerogative to divide the target number of pages into individual chapter page counts. As it turned out, this is an important exercise because it helps the Publishers frame deadlines (more on this in Act III).

This write-up is evaluated by a board of editors who get to decide the fate of your collaboration. Within a few days time, I got a call back from one of the Editors saying that they loved my ideas and we moved on to the next step.

### Act III - Contract

<p style="text-align: center;">
<b>Sheldon</b>: <i>It sounds like a, uh, contract might be in order.</i> <br />
<b>Leonard</b>: <i>Sure, we could write something up.</i> <br />
<b>Sheldon</b>: <i>But which one of us should be the party who ... </i> <br />
<b>Howard</b>: <i>You can do it, Sheldon.</i> <br />
<b>Sheldon</b>: <i>So stipulated!</i> <br />

The fate of your collaboration (and the book) is not sealed until the point the contract is signed. It is the single milestone that defines the beginning of your writing tenure under the aegis of the Publishers.

Like any other legal document, it had all the usual and tedious jargon. The things that interested me specifically were the clauses for the payment of the advance, royalties, copyright rules and the fact that the author is entitled to a fixed number (three) of free copies of the book. The contract also stipulates chapter-wise deadlines for submitting the 1st draft of each chapter in your book. These deadlines are calculated on the basis of the individual chapter lengths that were laid out in the “Book Outline”.

In my case, the chapter-wise deadlines were fixed at the rate of 2 pages per day which means that if I had laid down a plan of 30 pages for Chapter 1, I was given 15 days to to submit the 1st draft. As I would come to realise very soon, the overall writing process is extremely structured. As the submission dates for each chapter are known from the outset, you would know from the start when the first draft of each chapter is expected, the tentative release dates of your book etc. In short, academic publishing is the complete opposite of what George R. R. Martin is doing with ASOIAF series right now!

### Act IV - Grind

After signing the contract, the authors are expected to start writing! I was introduced to a Content Development Editor (CDE) who remained in touch with me throughout the major parts of the project. The CDE will help you get started by setting up the entire workflow. At this point, you will be given instructions on how to set up your editor (tip: If someone from the publishing industry asks you about the text editor of your choice, do not say Vim!), where to share your completed drafts etc. I came to know about the “Track Changes” feature for Microsoft Word — it is essentially version control for text documents. Having never faced any serious collaborations over non-code documents, I found this quite neat!

This phase was, by far, the most intense and enjoyable part of my entire journey.

> Writing a (technical) book doesn’t really fit into the idyllic image of epiphanies and creative revelations that hit you as you sit by the side of a meandering brook, absentmindedly stroking your beard as you scribble down verses and notes in your diary.

A closer image would be of a dishevelled lad, tearing at a packet of chips as he desperately claws at his keyboard at 3:30 in the night because well, deadlines. If you are working within deadlines set by the Publisher, then the days that you’d spend writing would be hard work. This is due to the fact that technical writing, for most authors, is part-time work. I was married to my regular job during the day, and I had to carve out time to woo writing by the night.

Like I said, I was sticking to a schedule which required me to push 2 pages per day (on an average). Although it sounds reasonable, given the fact that you are sending in supporting code snippets, diagrams, images and flowcharts along with the text. But maintaining this rate in a disciplined fashion throughout your entire writing tenure is hard, specially when you have to switch jobs and move to a different city in the midst of all this.

After penning down the “Book Outline”, there is a brief illusory phase where everything seems so simple and well-planned. After all, things were laid down bare in the Outline itself, how hard can expounding all the topics be? You just have to explain things in a bit more detail, thrown in a few code snippets here and there, and submit. Sounds easy, right? Reality hit me hard right at the very formative stages of Act IV. After an agonising 3 days of typing, I was staring at an incoherent jumble of sentences and paragraphs. I had no option, but to start all over again and this time around, I spent a lot of time micro-managing my set of topics by charting a logical and coherent route between them. A manifestation of “Things are easier said than done” made me realise that all elaborate plans look easy on paper. Thankfully, this was a skill that I picked up swiftly and my experience with the remaining chapters was much less tenuous which brings me to my next point.

In the process of writing, as I accrued more practice time (gained experience as time progressed), the lesser it took for me to write a fixed set of pages (the more efficient I became). Towards the final chapters, there were days when I managed to write as many as 5–6 pages in a single day — something that was unthinkable when I started out. In fact, I will go on to say that this is one of the most useful skills that I have picked up from the project. The prospect of writing and submitting multiple pages of text no longer perturbs me. I was watching a TED talk (whose link, I’m unfortunately unable to recall at the moment) where the speaker alluded to similar ideas and introduced the graph shown below.

<div style="text-align:center">

	<div class="figcpation" style="color:#555; font-size:14px;">
		An ilustration of the practice-performance graph. The more practice that you accrue, the lesser time it takes to accomplish a fixed quanta of work.
	</div>
</div> <br />

This is called the “Practice-Performance graph”. On the $$\mathbf{X}$$-axis, you have the time that you have devoted to your (long-term) task and the corresponding $$\mathbf{Y}$$-value will give you the amount of time it would take you to perform a fixed quanta of similar work.

So, I just talked about the importance of meticulous planning in writing. In fact, before starting out with the Grind, I sifted through tons of self-help tips for managing writing projects. Almost all of them had similar tips to offer — plan extensively before you write your first word. However, there is yet another, rather orthogonal skill that I picked up.

> Some of your best ideas will come to you after you actually start writing.

There is a limit to the granularity level to which you can plan your ideas before you actually begin pumping words. Sure, I had a list of topics and checkpoints that I wanted to write about for every chapter accompanied by a rough path mapped out among them. However, while penning down the draft for a topic, I realised that the best results appear when you go in with an open-mind. I rarely started out writing a section with all ideas pre-formed in my head. They kept coming to me as the words poured out. Gradually, I realised that most of the writing process was like walking a tight-rope between the two approaches — sticking to the plan and letting your mind wander in creative territories. In some sense, a writer similar to a reinforcement learning agent — aching to find that perfect balance between exploration of the unknown and exploitation of that charted, deterministic course.

During Act IV, as and when you keep on submitting your 1st drafts to the CDE, they simultaneously pass the same to the Technical Reviewers (TRs). The TRs submit their comments and reviews which are targeted at the technical content of the body of work. When the author is finally done with the 1st draft of all chapters, they are expected to immediately start off with the second iteration of reviewing and addressing the aforementioned comments. This obviously, does not take as much time as the writing itself. I remember completing the entire review process in about a couple of weeks.

One of the major challenges while writing was to explain technical concepts while simultaneously not losing sight of the big picture. How do you explain a 2-D Gaussian box filter to your readers when all they might be interested in is applying a cool Instagram-like effect to their images? Moreover, if a book is targeted for beginners (as is the case with mine), it becomes an incredibly potent tool that can shape the perspectives of a complete novice in the subject matter. It doesn’t help if the text gets so caught up with all the “fighting in the trenches” that your audience forgets their initial motivations. I believe that maintaining this balance is a fairly transferable skill that can be mapped to any creative domain. The TRs did a fantastic job in helping me understand (through their feedback and comments) and identify places where I was getting too caught up in the low-level details. Overall, Act V was instrumental in ironing out such occasional perturbations in the flow of the book.

After the Review was done, all that remained was tying up some lose ends — making sure all diagrams/flowcharts are proper, going through the PDFs to see how the Chapters would look in the final version and uploading the bundle of code/software.

At the time of writing this post, I am happy to say that the book has been published and is available for order (both the e-book and the print version) from the Publisher's [website](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/learning-opencv). It is scheduled to be available on Amazon soon. Also, all the supporting code snippets are open-source and available on [Github](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Learning-OpenCV-3-Application-Development).

Right now, I’m at a stage where I have absolutely no clue how about how the book will perform commercially. The future holds a giant question mark over my head. But, over the course of the last few months of painstaking labour, I have made an important realisation — “Books that don’t sell well are just as hard to write as books that do make money.” This makes you respect creative work.

Every morning, I started with a blank page and by the end of the day, I had filled it with words, numbers, symbols and diagrams. As I sit amid the lengthening shadows of a cold winter evening, I can’t help but reminisce that feeling of being reborn everyday.

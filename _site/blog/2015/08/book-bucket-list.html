    This is a curated list of all the books that I plan to read in the near future. I will keep on updating this list with short reviews of the books, as and when I complete them.
</div>

<ol>
  <li>
    <s>1984 by George Orwell</s>
    <p>A brilliant narration of a dystopian communist society. The book is marked by a gloomy chain of events describing the atrocities of an overlord organization governing it’s citizens that persist throughout a major portion of the story. The pessimism of the story-line is punctuated in places by the protagonists’ hopefulness, whose momentum is, unfortunately, unable to persist till the end. This is one of those novels that do not end on a positive note, leaving behind a concoction of despair and regret.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <s>To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee</s>
    <p>This was one rare educating, entertaining, thought provoking and pause-once-in-a-while-and-ponder literary masterpiece that I had the pleasure of coming across. The fact that the book manages to convey important lessons against racial prejudice while being amusingly entertaining at the same time is a proof of the author’s genius. For a story being narrated from the point-of-view of a 10 year girl struggling to figure out the rules of the adult world, “To Kill a Mockingbird” offers some profound insights into human nature that transcend cultural and religious barriers and have stood the test of time to be relevant even today.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <s>Kafka on the Shore by Haruki Murakami</s>
    <p>This was my first by Murakami and my feelings towards this book are very much like the story-line: convoluted. The opening pages of the book have all the ingredients of a gripping thriller. The faced-paced narrative does complete justice to the initial chapters making the reader’s expectations shoot to absurdly high levels. Unfortunately, the pages run out before you are able to make sense of the raging entangled mess of metaphors that the once gripping story has turned into.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Shantaram by Gregory David Roberts</li>
  <li>
    <s>Norwegian Wood by Haruki Murakami</s>
    <p>A much simpler and succint story in comparison to Kafka on the Shore (maybe Kafka was beyond my cognitive prowess!). On the surface, this appears to be yet another book describing the life and tribulations of a young university student in Japan revolving around booze, relationships, casual hook-ups and sex. However, scratching the flaky exterior triggers a landslide of feelings. The only way to understand and appreciate the book is to grasp the gravity of the emotions shared among the characters. And that is possible only by immersing one’s self in the world of Toru Wantabe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <s>Battle Hymns of the Tiger Mother by Amy Chua</s>
    <p>As an outlier (by genre) in my this year’s collection, Amy Chua’s satirical memoir was an interesting read. The motivation’s for it’s inclusion into my list stemmed from the widespread controversy it had managed to attract from almost all parts of the world. The book discussses Chinese parenting by drawing parallels with how Western (especially US) parents raise their kids. Inspite of the fact that the entire book is about the life of a Chinese mother struggling to raise two progiduous daughters, the author manages to keep the narrative refreshingly entertaining. Hailing from India, a place where parenting styles are an average of the Chinese and the Western way, I could relate to and agree with a lot of her opinions and found some of them too overbearing.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Kite Runner by Khaled Hosseini</li>
  <li>War and Peace by Leo Tolstoy</li>
  <li>The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky</li>
  <li>The Potrait of a Lady by Henry James</li>
  <li>Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen</li>
  <li>Animal Farm by George Orwell</li>
  <li>Lolita by Vladimir Nabokov</li>
  <li>The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger</li>
  <li>Dracula by Bram Stroker</li>
</ol>
